Digital revolution and decentralization have given the finance industry many benefits. Cryptocurrencies and tokens have emerged as a dynamic and fascinating aspect of decentralized and blockchain space. As the world has increased pace in decentralization and digitalization, understanding these types of assets has become crucial. In this blog, we will explore its definition, use cases, and types of tokens.

## Defining Crypto Tokens.

A crypto token represents ownership or access on a blockchain so it is called a virtual asset. Token operates within existing(native) blockchain platforms, representing ownership in a company or access to any respective services, which shows why tokens are called diverse assets.

## Types of Crypto Tokens

There are several types of tokens and they are differentiated based on use cases. In the below list, the most common type of crypto token is mentioned.

### 1. Utility Tokens

A token that is issued by an organization or a project as a part of a blockchain-based platform. Unlike other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin, which gives a medium of transaction. Utility tokens have a purpose to offer in the ecosystem itself. Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard has the potential to create a utility token in the Ethereum ecosystem. 

### 2. Security Tokens

Security tokens are a type of token that represents ownership or a stake in ecosystem assets, security tokens are typically a representation of an investment contract. Security tokens are designed to derive value from tradable assets and are subject to relevant securities.

### 3. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

NFTs are indivisible which means this type of token cannot be traded in fractions, like other tokens. Each NFT has its unique attributes, making them different from each other tokens. This type of uniqueness is achieved through cryptographic signatures and metadata that are associated with the token.

## **Use Cases of Crypto Tokens**

### 1. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Crypto tokens are driving the decentralized finance revolution by neglecting traditional intermediaries and providing access to financial services across the globe. Tokenomics is the new economics of decentralization. DeFi can also help in doing transactions around the globe with very small transaction charges known as gas fees in the blockchain.

### 2. Gaming and Virtual Assets

NFTs and Crypto tokens are taking these industries to the next level. NFTs and virtual assets provide true ownership of in-game assets and characters. This can also help with using NFT skins across the games and leverage investments and can also help in the trade-in of assets easily as compared to the traditional market.

### 3. Supply Chain Management

Tokenize an asset by splitting it into shares that have a digital representation of ownership. These types of tokens can transfer ownership without exchanging the physical assets. Transparency will build trust by collecting key data points, such as certificates and claims, which provides open access to data publicly. Sometimes to prevent injury and illness, consumer products or raw ingredients need to be recalled, in this situation, tokens are easy to trace consumers and ownerships.

## **Challenges and Risks**

Recognize the challenges and risks associated with crypto tokens, that will play a vital role in adoption, regulations, etc. Striking the right balance in tokenomics, requires careful planning to ensure the token’s long-term viability, and acceptance including supply, distribution, and utility. Ensure security of vulnerabilities and security as smart contracts can have security breaches if not conducted required audits.

Evaluate the purpose of token creation, there is always a purpose for token creation. Preferred to use token with strong purpose and utility. Utility is another thing to look for in any token to avoid value degradation. There are several tokens and NFTs without any utility and they are facing several value degradation after 2022 which can create a huge risk in terms of valuation, there can be a case for shutting down the project, and tokens can be useless if the purpose or utility is not fruitful.

## **Conclusion**

In summary, as we have seen how crypto tokens can be revolutionary things, it gives a clear idea they’re more than just a token. They are changing the way we access services, own things and see value in this decentralization era. They provide a way more efficient and transparent way to own and trade utilities. But there are challenges, and dealing with them will need careful attention, flexibility, and dedication to come up with new ideas that are fulfilling the principles of being decentralized and transparent. These decentralized tokens are still at the beginning of this journey, and how the future can be shaped by the many possibilities of crypto tokens can be answered by keeping watch on all updates and how they can be adopted in the industry.
