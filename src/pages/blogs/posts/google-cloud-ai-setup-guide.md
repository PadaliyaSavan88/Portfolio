## **1. Introduction**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries by automating processes, improving decision-making, and enhancing customer experiences. If you're a **startup founder, SaaS builder, or developer**, integrating AI into your applications can give you a competitive edge.

In this guide, weâ€™ll cover everything you need to **set up AI workloads on Google Cloud**, from creating an account to training and deploying a model. This is a **detailed extension** of my [Medium article](https://padaliyasavan.medium.com/getting-started-with-ai-on-google-cloud-a-beginners-guide-eb8bb941ae8c) on getting started with AI on Google Cloud.

## **2. Google Cloud Account Setup**

Before we begin, letâ€™s **set up a Google Cloud account** and enable the required AI services.

#### **Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Account**

1. Go to Google Cloud Console.
2. Click **Get Started for Free** and follow the steps to create an account.
3. Google offers **$300 in free credits** for new users.

#### **Step 2: Enable AI APIs**

To work with AI models, we need to enable **Google AI APIs**:

1. Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library** in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Search and enable the following APIs:
    - Vertex AI API
    - AutoML API
    - Cloud Vision API (for image recognition)
    - Cloud Natural Language API (for text processing)
    - Cloud Speech-to-Text API (for speech recognition)

#### **Step 3: Set Up Billing**

- Google requires **billing to be enabled** even if you are using free credits.
- Go to **Billing > Link a Payment Method** and add your details.

## **3. Deploying Your First AI Model on Google Cloud**

Now that our setup is ready, letâ€™s **train and deploy an AI model** using AutoML.

#### **Step 1: Create a Dataset for AutoML**

1. Open the Vertex AI Dashboard.
2. Click **Create Dataset > Select Image Classification (or your preferred task)**.
3. Upload images (or import from Cloud Storage).
4. Click **Train Model** and let AutoML handle the rest!

#### **Step 2: Deploy the Model**

1. Once training is complete, navigate to **Deploy & Test Model**.
2. Select **Cloud Run** as the deployment option for a serverless AI-powered API.
3. Click **Deploy**, and Google Cloud will handle scaling automatically.

#### **Step 3: Make Predictions Using API**

Once deployed, you can use the model via an API request:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "instances": [{"image": {"content": "base64_encoded_image"}}]
         }' \

```

## **4. Running AI Workloads in Production**

Once your model is deployed, itâ€™s important to optimize it for production.

#### **Best Practices for Running AI on Google Cloud**

**Use Cloud Functions & Cloud Run** for **scalable inference**

**Optimize AI costs** with **AutoML Edge & GPU tuning**

**Use BigQuery & Dataflow** for **large-scale AI workloads**
